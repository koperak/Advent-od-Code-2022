# What's about
Day 10 seemed easy but it was hard for me to catch the buggy assumption that result is allways calculeted after two-cycle addx, it was not true, so i had to iterate every operations ie. one-cycle noop's and two-cycle addx'c cycle by cycle. 

# What to learn 
Part two seems interesting but I'm quite exuausted and not going into this.
